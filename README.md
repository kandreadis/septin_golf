# Septin Golf Ball Analysis

_Author: Konstantinos Andreadis_

=> Simply run **main.py** using Python.

This automatically loops through all .tif files in "**data**" grouped by "**cross_section**" and "**surface**".
The output figures and spike spacing csv spreadsheets are saved in "figures" and "result", respectively.
To change the plots and/or increase their saving resolution, adapt **visualisation.py**.
To improve detection/analysis steps during image analysis, adapt **analysis.py**.

For more information on the image analysis workflow, script parameters/output & co. please consult Konstantinos
